-------------
need to make 5 or so sounds (really simple ones), to play when the rain falls on a robobrrd
try and fade out the robobrrds when they leave the screen bounds
eventually clean up rainscene (and remove other files)
fix white on robobrrd sprite
experiment with colours on robobrrd sprite
sprite kit seems fun
